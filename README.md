# About Me

I received my BSc and PhD from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2011 and 2017 respectively, and my supervisor is Prof. Quan-Sen Sun. I am now a full Professor in School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology. During 2017-2018, I was a research fellow in Rolls-Royce@NTU Corp Lab, Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Prof. Yew-Soon Ong. In 2015, I worked with Prof. Heng Tao SHEN as a research assistant in Data and Knowledge Engineering group, University of Queensland. In 2016, I worked with Prof. Ivor W. Tsang as a research assistant in Centre for Artificial Intelligence, University of Technology Sydney.

# Research Interests
I have broad interests in machine learning, computer vision, and data mining. Particularly, I focus on developing algorithms of Multi-view Learning, Multi- label Learning, Hashing, Network Embedding Learning and applying them to Large-scale Retrieval, Classification, Clustering problems.
